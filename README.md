# VRTKBuild
My first VR vertical slice. Built using the Oculus SDK and VRTK.

The Assets used were available in the VRTK or I imported from the Asset Store. 

I was able to implement Gameplay, UI and Audio as well as basic Lightmap setup and Scene Light baking.

Do let me know if the build has any errors and do be free to check out the project files I uploaded if you see anything wrong. (You'll need a Oculus Rift setup for checking it out unfortunately as that was the only system I had temporarily to use the VRTK)
